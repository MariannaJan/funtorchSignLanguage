      Sign Language are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning.Sign languages are full-fledged
      natural languages with their own grammar and lexiconused worldwide not onlyby thedeaf and hard of hearing,
      butalsoby hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken
      language, or those with deaf family members, such as children of deaf adults.
    </div>
    <div class="desc">
      Although, such languages have been around for a while,thereis a very small percentage of world populationthat
      knows how to interpret them. Through our project we tried to somehow bridge this communication gap by
      providingeveryone with the opportunity to interpret the hand signs by use of an application or software
      interface. Thissign-language interpreter isjust a prototype whichfar from perfectand not yet capable of being
      used in real world conditions, but we believe it is a step in the right direction!
    </div>
    <div class="desc">
      Here we have started small and tried classifying the numbers 0-9 signed usingAmerican Sign Language. The most
      part of the data in form of images has been collected and contributed by the members of our group and other
      helpful volunteers, usingtheirwebcams. The model is a custom-madelightweight convolution neural network with
      small number of parameters.The model iscurrently trainedon around 6000sign language images. It achieves more than
      96% testingaccuracy.Don’t forget to check out this small-demo video below.

        </p>
        <p>
          java -version
        </p>
        <p>If the JDK is not available, or the version is lower than 7, download it <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">here</a>.
